# miniRT-for-Linux

miniRT-for-Linux is a 42 Programming School project that will help us to understand how raytracing and raymarching works in terms of primitive 3D objects.

## Installation

This project is still under construction but it will be available soon (probably on November 20th).

If you want to check the progress there is a really basic version of it.

```bash
cd mk1 && make test
```
